# 03 — Linked Lists

## Overview
Linked Lists are **linear data structures** where elements are connected using pointers instead of contiguous memory locations. Unlike arrays, linked lists allow dynamic memory allocation and efficient insertions and deletions.

This module introduces different types of linked lists and builds the foundation for understanding **pointer-based data structures**, which are essential for advanced algorithms.

---

## Learning Objectives
By completing this module, you will be able to:
- Understand how linked lists store and manage data
- Differentiate between singly, doubly, and circular linked lists
- Perform basic operations such as insertion, deletion, and traversal
- Analyze time and space complexity of linked list operations
- Apply linked list concepts to real-world and ML-related problems

---

## Contents
This folder covers the following topics:

- **Singly Linked List**  
  Nodes connected in one direction using a single pointer.

- **Doubly Linked List**  
  Nodes connected in both forward and backward directions.

- **Circular Linked List**  
  The last node points back to the first node, forming a loop.

- **Code Examples**  
  Python implementations of linked list operations.

## Why This Matters for Machine Learning
Although high-level ML frameworks hide memory details, linked list concepts help ML engineers:

- Understand dynamic data handling
- Manage streaming or sequential data
- Build intuition for graph-based and pointer-heavy structures
- Improve low-level algorithmic thinking

This knowledge becomes important in **systems-level ML and research**.

## How to Use This Module
1. Start with `Singly_LinkedList.md`
2. Move to `Doubly_LinkedList.md`
3. Study `Circular_LinkedList.md`
4. Practice implementations from `Code_Examples`
5. Analyze time and space trade-offs for each structure

## Interview Relevance
Linked Lists are frequently tested in interviews. This module prepares you for problems such as:
- Reversing a linked list
- Detecting cycles
- Finding the middle node
- Merging two sorted lists

Strong linked list fundamentals demonstrate **pointer control and logical precision**.

---

## What’s Next
After completing this module, proceed to:
- **04_Stacks_and_Queues**, which build on linked list concepts.
