# 01 — Basics of Data Structures & Algorithms

## Overview
This module introduces the **foundational programming and algorithmic concepts** required to build a strong base in Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA), with a clear focus on **Machine Learning (ML) readiness**.

A solid understanding of these basics is essential before moving on to advanced DSA topics and their applications in machine learning, data science, and AI systems.

## Learning Objectives
By completing this module, you will be able to:
- Understand how programs execute at a fundamental level
- Write clean, structured, and readable code
- Analyze the efficiency of algorithms using time and space complexity
- Build the algorithmic thinking required for ML pipelines and model implementation

---

## Contents
This folder covers the following topics:

- **Variables and Data Types**  
  Understanding how data is stored and manipulated in memory.

- **Loops and Conditionals**  
  Controlling program flow and implementing logical decision-making.

- **Functions and Scope**  
  Writing reusable, modular code and understanding variable scope.

- **Complexity Analysis**  
  Introduction to Big-O notation, time complexity, and space complexity.

- **Basics Code Examples**  
  Practical implementations to reinforce theoretical concepts.

## Why This Matters for Machine Learning
Machine Learning frameworks abstract many details, but **ML engineers must still reason algorithmically**.

These basics are critical for:
- Writing efficient data preprocessing pipelines
- Understanding how ML libraries optimize computations
- Debugging performance bottlenecks
- Transitioning from “using models” to **building systems**

Without strong fundamentals, scaling ML solutions becomes difficult.

---

## Expected Prerequisites
- Basic familiarity with programming (preferably Python)
- Curiosity to understand *how things work under the hood*

No prior DSA knowledge is required.

## How to Use This Module
1. Read each concept file in order  
2. Study the examples carefully  
3. Implement variations of the provided code  
4. Analyze time and space complexity for each solution  

This module sets the **thinking foundation** for the rest of the repository.

## What’s Next
After completing this section, you should move to:
- **02_Arrays_and_Strings**, where algorithmic problem-solving begins in earnest.
