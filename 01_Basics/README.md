# 01_Basics

## 🚀 Overview
Welcome to the **Basics of Programming & Algorithmic Thinking**.  
This section lays the foundation for learning **Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)** and is crucial for anyone preparing for **Machine Learning**.  

Here you will learn:
- Core programming concepts in Python (or your preferred language)
- How to think algorithmically
- Time and space complexity analysis

---

## 📚 Topics Covered

1. **Variables and Data Types** (`Variables_and_DataTypes.md`)  
   - Understanding variables and constants  
   - Primitive and non-primitive data types  
   - Mutable vs immutable types  
   - Type casting and type conversion

2. **Loops and Conditionals** (`Loops_and_Conditionals.md`)  
   - `if`, `else`, `elif` statements  
   - `for` and `while` loops  
   - Nested loops and loop control statements (`break`, `continue`, `pass`)  

3. **Functions and Scope** (`Functions_and_Scope.md`)  
   - Defining and calling functions  
   - Parameters and return values  
   - Local vs global scope  
   - Lambda functions and higher-order functions  

4. **Complexity Analysis** (`Complexity_Analysis.md`)  
   - Introduction to Big O notation  
   - Time complexity examples  
   - Space complexity analysis  
   - Best, average, and worst case scenarios  

5. **Code Examples** (`Basics_Code_Examples/`)  
   - Ready-to-run Python examples for each topic  
   - Practice problems with explanations  
   - Step-by-step walkthroughs for beginners  

---

## 💡 Learning Tips
- Write code by hand to understand the flow  
- Dry-run small examples on paper before coding  
- Focus on understanding **why an algorithm works**, not just how  
- Try modifying examples to explore edge cases
